# alfLanguage
Parse the ALF language source file and generate a JSON abstract syntax tree (AST). The assignment will take one or two command line parameters. The first paremeter is the filename with the ALF script, the second is the output file. If the output file is missing, it will have the same name as the script file with the extension ".json".
